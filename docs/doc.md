### Building the Documentation
To build the documentation, first install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```
pip install ".[docs]"
```

You also need to ensure you have `doxygen` installed, it is available as a package on all common distributions.
Then run `mkdocs serve` to build the documentation and start a local HTTP server to view it.
