### Setting up Git Hooks

For development, please install the pre-commit formatting check hook
by running
```bash
  ./setup_git_hooks.sh
```
in the root directory of this repository.
We suggest using the git hook only when you plan to commit/push from command line.
The git hook does not work together with the commit/push function of Clion.
In case you want to use Clion or another IDE, we recommend using the built-in functionality of the IDE.
