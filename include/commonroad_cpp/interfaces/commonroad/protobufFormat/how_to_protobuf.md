# HOW TO PROTOBUF

The definition files can be found in `include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/definitionFiles/`. The file
`commonroad.proto` contains the root of the whole message and imports all submessages which are divided
and stored in multiple files with ending `.proto`.
The corresponding source and header files are automatically generated by the build system.

The following command can be used to create the source and header files manually:
```
protoc -I=./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/definitionFiles/ --cpp_out=./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/generatedClasses  ./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/definitionFiles/*.proto
```
We recommend to use libprotoc 3.6.1 for generating the code (you can check the version via ```protoc --version```).
