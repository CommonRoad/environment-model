# HOW TO PROTOBUF

The definition files can be found in `include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/definitionFiles/`. The file
`commonroad.proto` contains the root of the whole message and imports all submessages which are divided
and stored in multiple files with ending `.proto`.
The corresponding source and header files are automatically generated by the build system.

The following command can be used to create the source and header files manually:
```
 protoc -I=./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/common \
 -I=./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/dynamic \
 -I=./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/map \
 -I=./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/scenario \
 --cpp_out=./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/generated \
 ./include/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/commonroad/protobufFormat/**/*.proto
```
We recommend to use libprotoc 3.6.1 for generating the code (you can check the version via ```protoc --version```).
