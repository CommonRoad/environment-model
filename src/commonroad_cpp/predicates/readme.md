**0. General Information** 
---------------------------
The current predicate "architecture/layout" is as follows:  
C++ side:   
- Each predicate has its own class derived from an interface
- Predicates have a function for boolean, constraint, and robust evaluation.
- The functions derived from the interface have the following parameter list: timeStep, world, obstacleK, obstacleP
- Those functions can be overloaded with functions using value-based parameters (e.g., providing directly acceleration, velocity, etc.).
- The Python interface for each predicate has the following parameter list: scenarioID, timeStep, obstacleK-ID, obstacleP-ID (the scenario must be registered beforehand and should also be removed after usage)

**1. Create New Branch and Merge Request**  
------------------------------------------
If you want to add or change a predicate, please first create a branch and corresponding merge request. Add *Draft* or *WIP* into the name of the merge request until the predicate implementation is finished.  

**2. Implementation**  
---------------------
Some notes for adding/updating the predicate implementation:
- Every C++ predicate must be derived from the *[Predicate](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/src/commonroad_cpp/predicates/predicate.h)* interface class. 
- Each predicate should have an own source and header file and should be located in the corresponding directory (braking, velocity, ...)

- Examples for predicates: [SafeDistance](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/src/commonroad_cpp/predicates/braking/safe_distance_predicate.h), [InFrontOf](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/src/commonroad_cpp/predicates/position/in_front_of_predicate.h), [InSameLane](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/src/commonroad_cpp/predicates/position/in_same_lane_predicate.h), [UnnecessaryBraking](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/src/commonroad_cpp/predicates/braking/unnecessary_braking_predicate.h)

- The constraint mode has currently only limited functionality (only real-valued constraints)

- It could be difficult to add a constraint or robust evaluation to each predicate (in general it should be possible, but the overhead would be quite large). If it should be skipped for the moment, add a runtime exception (not adding the function definition could also work, the linker would probably then raise an error).

- Not all predicates have/need a value-based parameter list (additionally to the object list defined in the general predicate interface class). Depending on the predicate, the parameter list could be quite long.

- The source file of a new predicate must be added in the [CMakeLists.txt](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/src/CMakeLists.txt)

The following may be added in the future:
- namespaces for predicates for better differentiation between velocity, braking, etc. 

**3. Add/Update C++ Test Case**  
-------------------------------
- The test cases should be located in a similar hierarchy as the predicate implementation under [tests/envModelTests/predicates](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/tree/develop/tests/envModelTests/predicates)

- The source file of a new predicate test case must be added in the [CMakeLists.txt](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/tests/CMakeLists.txt)

- Examples for predicate test cases: [SafeDistance](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/tests/envModelTests/predicates/braking/test_safe_distance_predicate.h), [InFrontOf](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/tests/envModelTests/predicates/position/test_in_front_of_predicate.h), [InSameLane](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/tests/envModelTests/predicates/position/test_in_same_lane_predicate.h), [UnnecessaryBraking](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/tests/envModelTests/predicates/braking/test_unnecessary_braking_predicate.h)

- the function [create_road_network](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/tests/envModelTests/predicates/utils_predicate_test.h) creates a road network with two adjacent lanelets (depending on the predicate this function must be adjusted)

**4. Add/Update Python Interface**  
----------------------------------
- The Python interfaces are located under [src/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/pybind/python_interface.h](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/tree/develop/src/commonroad_cpp/interfaces/pybind/python_interface.h)

- New interfaces can be implemented similar to the existing ones.

**5. Add/Update Python Test Case**  
----------------------------------
- The test cases should be located in a similar hierarchy as the predicate implementation under [tests/python/predicates](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/tree/develop/tests/python/predicates)

- the function [create_lanelet_network](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/environment-model/-/blob/develop/tests/python/predicates/predicate_test_utils.py) creates a road network with five adjacent lanelets (depending on the predicate this function must be adjusted)

- New interfaces can be implemented similar to the existing ones.

- For existing Python predicates the test case [here](https://gitlab.lrz.de/maierhofer/commonroad_monitor/-/tree/master/tests) can be used. However, they have to be updated to fit to the new interface.
